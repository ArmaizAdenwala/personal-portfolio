            The mask itself consists of 7 rows of __WS2182B 144 LEDs/m
            Neopixels__. There are a total of 161 LEDs, with the first row being
            26. Each row decrements by 1, which means the 7th row will have 19
            Neopixels. Since we are decrementing by an odd number, we will line
            up the pixels to be inbetween the two pixels above it. This results
            in a hexagon-like geometric pattern which will allow us to make
            awesome patterns for our visuals.

            The order of WS2182B pins can differ depending on the brand. In my
            case, the order was `Ground`, `Data`, and `Power`. These are
            represented with `G`, `I/O`, `+` respecively. These leds are
            individually addressable so the order of these leds matter. When you
            get a Neopixel strip, it will be one long strip of 144 leds or so.
            You can cut these leds between these pins and solder them together
            as seen with the image above, making sure that the `O` pin connects
            to the `I` pin.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The problem is that the Arduino won't see this in the shape of a
            mask, it will still think of it as one long strip. As seen with the
            full-sized image, the leds snake around, having each alternating row
            flipped. This is so that we do not have long wires going from one
            end of the mask to the other (I marked the flow of the led strip's
            data pin using arrows). This means that the 26th led is the last led
            in the first row, 27th led is the last led of the 2nd row, 28th led
            is the 2nd to last led of the 2nd row, and the 51st led is the first
            led of the 2nd row.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Luckily, this isn't an issue if all of our designs are symetrical,
            because the `27th` led and the `51st` leds would be the same color.
            If our designs are not symetical, we would need a helper function
            which could use more memory.
          </Paragraph>
          <Title>Creating The Mask</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            In order to keep the leds in place and wearable, I bought an airsoft
            mask and measured that the first row of 26 LEDs would fit. After
            that, I measured the maximum amount of rows I could fit while
            keeping the "decrement by 1" rule. In my case it was 7 rows. Once
            everything was measured, the leds were cut and soldered, ensuring
            each alternating row flipped. Then the back of the neopixels were
            taped together using electrical tape. Once the leds were soldered
            together, I used a braided fishing line to sew the leds to the mask
            as it was the neatest method I found. This is my suggested approach
            in creating the mask itself.

            The Arduino is connected to the mask's data pin through th `A5` pin.
            There is a 470ohm resistor prior to reaching the Arduino's pin. The
            mask is powered by a battery pack with 3 AA batteries. The ground
            cable is connected to the arduino and the mask. The power cable of
            the battery is connected to the mask's `+` pin. You can also connect
            the power to the Arduino's `5V` pin, however, we won't worry about
            that until we are finished programming it. The Arduino will be
            connected to our computer using a usb cable.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            _Alternatively, you could upgrade the battery pack from `4.5V` to
            `4.8V` by using 4 Reachargable NiMH batteries at `1.2V` each. As
            long as you limit the power to the neopixels to be under `5V`, you
            should be ok._

            enough to place them in your pocket, or anywhere you plan on keeping

            Once you create the new sketch, you will be presented with a default
            template. We will need to import and setup the FastLED library:

#define BRIGHTNESS 20

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup()
{
  FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE, LED_PIN>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
  FastLED.setMaxPowerInVoltsAndMilliamps(4.5, 500);
  FastLED.show();

}`}
          </CodeBlock>
          <Paragraph>
            {'`#include <FastLED.h>`: This imports our FastLED Library'}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `#define LED_PIN A5`: This tells FastLED that we are using the A5
            pin for our LEDs
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>`#define NUM_LEDS 161`: The # of LEDs we have</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `#define LED_TYPE WS2812B`: This is the type of LEDs we are using
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `#define BRIGHTNESS 20`: This sets the brightness of our LEDs.
            Neopixels are bright and use a lot of power. Having this higher
            means that we use more power but have a larger range of colors.
            Using a smaller number results in a much smaller ranger of colors.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];`: This defines our `leds` array which we will
            use to assign colors to specific LEDs. The `CRGB` object refers to
            an `RGB` pixel.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            {
              '`FastLED.addLeds<...>(...);`: Sets up our LEDs for us and will instantiate the `leds` variable. It takes in the type of leds, pin, leds array, and number of leds as parameters.'

          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `FastLED.setMaxPowerInVoltsAndMilliamps(4.5, 500);`: This uses a
            helper method that is provided by FastLED to automatically handle
            the power draw by passing in the volts of our power (`4.5V`)
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `FastLED.show();`: Whenever we change the LEDs, the `show` method
            would need to be called to display the newly assigned LEDs.

          <Paragraph>
            {
              'Here comes the fun part: creating the visuals. The implementation I did was to create a 1d array with a length of `NUM_LEDS` and called it `pattern`. We will fill `pattern` with integers that indicate the color that will be assigned to an led. In addition to the `pattern` array, there will be a 2d array for RGB colors that `pattern` would use to determine the color that needs to be outputted. We will call this `colors`. To save memory, we will share the `colors` array among all designs, so that colors can be reused without taking additional memory. We can achieve this by creating the 1d array `patternColors` that will bridge the `pattern` values to a color in `colors`. So if the value of the first item in `patterns` is `0`, the 0th index of the `patternsColors`array could have a value of `2` which refers to the `2nd` index of `colors`. In this scenario the 2nd index could have a value of `{0, 100, 0}`, which will show a green LED (RGB).'

          <Paragraph>
            Here is a visual for how the 0th and 1st iterations would look like
            for a mask with 6 leds:
          </Paragraph>
          <img
            className="full-width-img"
            src={MaskColorsArray0}
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <Paragraph>
            The Arduino will parse through each value in this array which in
            this case the current value is `1`. So it finds the value of
            `patternColors[1]` and gets `0`. It then gets the value of
            `colors[0]`
          </Paragraph>
          <img
            className="full-width-img"
            src={MaskColorsArray1}
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <Paragraph>
            Now in the 2nd iteration, the value increments by 1 and is now `2`.
            (_When we program this, the array wont be mutated, we will instead
            calculate it using `%`. `(1 + 0) % 3 = 1`, `(1 + 1) % 3 = 2`, and
            `(1 + 2) % 3 = 0`_)
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            We will then wrap it in a loop so that each interation rotates the
            color. So if the `0th` index of `pattern` has a value of `1`, it
            will have a value of `2` in the 2nd iteration. This allows us to
            animate our leds. We can take it a step further by nesting it
            another for loop that would fade into the next "frame". Check out
            the before and after adding this effect in the video below. The
            effect without the fade goes outward, while the one with the fade
            goes inward. Notice how the inward effect looks drastically
            smoother:
