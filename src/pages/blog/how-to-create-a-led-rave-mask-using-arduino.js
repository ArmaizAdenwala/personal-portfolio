          <Paragraph>
            `ARDUINO NANO`: ~$3-$5 - Used to control the LEDs
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `2 x 1 METER 144LEDS/M WS2182B NON-WATERPROOF`: ~$40-$60 - 144
            LEDs/m is a lot of pixels, so 60 LEDS/m could work as well and is
            far cheaper and easier to solder. Waterproof versions can be harder
            to hold in place in the mask.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `3 x BATTERY PACK`: $1-$5 - You can use a 4 pack ONLY if you use
            1.2V NiMH rechargeable batteries. Your NeoPixels will break if you
            use 4 normal 1.5V batteries.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `3 x AA 1.5V BATTERIES`: $2 - You can use 1.2V NiMH rechargeable
            batteries as long as you stay below 5V and high enough to show
            colors properly.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `SILICON WIRES`: ~$10-$15 - Needed to connect the LEDs together.
            Jumper cables won't work in this project.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `MASK`: ~$12 - Any airsoft mesh mask should work.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `USB A TO MINI B CABLE`: ~$5 - Arduino Nanos use a cable different
            from the Uno
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `HEATSHRINK`: ~$2 - Keeps your wires and solders clean and secure.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `Arduino Uno Case / Project Box`: ~$2-~$4 - Can be 3d printed as
            well, but should fit your battery pack and Arduino Nano.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `470 OHM RESISTOR`: Helps keep the signal to the NeoPixels clear
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            If you don't have one already, you will need a soldering iron and
            solder wire. Be sure to be extra safe when soldering and not breathe
            the smoke by taking proper precautions. Soldering is difficult, be
            sure to look up guides on how to solder properly.

            The mask itself consists of 7 rows of __WS2182B 144 LEDs/m
            NeoPixels__. There are a total of 161 LEDs, with the first row being
            26. Each row decrements by 1, which means the 7th row will have 19
            NeoPixels. Since we are decrementing by an odd number, we will line
            up the pixels to be in-between the two pixels above it. This results
            in a hexagon-like geometric pattern which will allow us to make
            awesome patterns for our visuals.

            The order of WS2182B pins can differ depending on the brand. In my
            case, the order was `Ground`, `Data`, and `Power`. These are
            represented with `G`, `I/O`, `+` respectively. These LEDs are
            individually addressable so the order of these LEDs matter. When you
            get a Neopixel strip, it will be one long strip of 144 leds or so.
            You can cut these leds between these pins and solder them together
            as seen with the image above, making sure that the `O` pin connects
            to the `I` pin.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The problem is that the Arduino won't see this in the shape of a
            mask, it will still think of it as one long strip. As seen with the
            full-sized image, the LEDs snake around, having each alternating row
            flipped. You can tell the direction of the LEDs based on the `I` and
            `O` pins of one end of the LED strip. This is so that we do not have
            long wires going from one end of the mask to the other (I marked the
            flow of the LED strip's data pin using arrows). This means that the
            26th LED is the last LED in the first row, 27th LED is the last LED
            of the 2nd row, 28th LED is the 2nd to last LED of the 2nd row, and
            the 51st LED is the first LED of the 2nd row.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Luckily, this isn't an issue if all of our designs are symmetrical,
            because the 27th LED and the 51st LEDs would be the same color. If
            our designs are not symmetrical, we would need a helper function to
            flip each row which could use more memory.

          <Title>Creating The Mask</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            In order to keep the LEDs in place and wearable, I bought an airsoft
            mask and measured that the first row of 26 LEDs would fit. After
            that, I measured the maximum amount of rows I could fit while
            keeping the "decrement by 1" rule. In my case it was 7 rows. Once
            everything was measured, the LEDs were cut and soldered, ensuring
            each alternating row flipped. Then the back of the NeoPixels were
            taped together using electrical tape. I used a braided fishing line
            to sew the LEDs to the mask.

            The Arduino is connected to the mask's data pin through th `A5` pin.
            There is a `470ohm` resistor prior to reaching the Arduino's pin.
            This will keep the signal clear to the NeoPixels. The mask is
            powered by a battery pack with 3 AA batteries. The ground cable is
            connected to the Arduino and the mask. The power cable of the
            battery is connected to the mask's `+` pin. You can also connect the
            power to the Arduino's `5V` pin, however, we won't worry about that
            until we are finished programming it. The Arduino will be connected
            to our computer using a usb cable.

          <Paragraph>
            _Alternatively, you could upgrade the battery pack from `4.5V` to
            `4.8V` by using 4 Rechargable NiMH batteries at `1.2V` each. As long
            as you limit the power to the NeoPixels to be under `5V`, you should
            be ok._

            Once you create the new sketch, you will be presented with a default

          <Paragraph>
            {'`#include <FastLED.h>`: This imports our FastLED Library'}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `#define LED_PIN A5`: This tells FastLED that we are using the A5
            pin for our LEDs
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>`#define NUM_LEDS 161`: The # of LEDs we have</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `#define LED_TYPE WS2812B`: This is the type of LEDs we are using
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `#define BRIGHTNESS 20`: This sets the brightness of our LEDs.
            NeoPixels are bright and use a lot of power. Having this higher
            means that we use more power but have a larger range of colors.
            Using a smaller number results in a much smaller ranger of colors.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];`: This defines our `leds` array which we will
            use to assign colors to specific LEDs. The `CRGB` object refers to
            an `RGB` pixel.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            {
              '`FastLED.addLeds<...>(...);`: Sets up our LEDs for us and will instantiate the `leds` variable. It takes in the type of LEDs, pin, LEDs array, and number of LEDs as parameters.'

          <Paragraph>
            `FastLED.setMaxPowerInVoltsAndMilliamps(4.5, 500);`: This uses a
            helper method that is provided by FastLED to automatically handle
            the power draw by passing in the volts of our power supply (`4.5V`)
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `FastLED.show();`: Whenever we change the LEDs, the `show` method
            would need to be called to display the newly assigned LEDs.

          <Title>Visuals Overview</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            {
              'Here comes the fun part: creating the visuals. The implementation I did was to create a 1d array with a length of `NUM_LEDS` and called it `pattern`. We will fill `pattern` with integers that indicate the color that will be assigned to an LED. In addition to the `pattern` array, there will be a 2d array for RGB colors that `pattern` would use to determine the color that needs to be outputted. We will call this `colors`. To save memory, we will share the `colors` array among all designs, so that colors can be reused without taking additional memory. We can achieve this by creating the 1d array `patternColors` that will bridge the `pattern` values to a color in `colors`. So if the value of the first item in `patterns` is `0`, the 0th index of the `patternsColors`array could have a value of `2` which refers to the `2nd` index of `colors`. In this scenario the 2nd index could have a value of `{0, 100, 0}`, which will show a green LED (RGB).'
            }
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            We want to animate the visuals, so we will wrap everything in a loop
            so that the colors rotate each iteration. Here is a visual for how
            the 0th and 1st iterations would look like for a mask with 6 leds:
          </Paragraph>
          <LazyLoadImage
            className="full-width-img"
            src={MaskColorsArray0}
            alt="A visual that shows how the 5th item in the pattern array is equal to 1 which represents the index in the pattern color array which then points to a color in the color array"
          />
          <Paragraph>
            The Arduino will parse through each value in the `pattern` array
            which in this case the current value is `1`. So it finds the value
            of `patternColors[1]` and gets `0`. It then gets the value of
            `colors[0]`
          </Paragraph>
          <LazyLoadImage
            className="full-width-img"
            src={MaskColorsArray1}
            alt="A visual showing the next iteration of the pattern array where every value in the pattern array increments by one, with the highest value looping back to 0."
          />
          <Paragraph>
            Now in the 2nd iteration, the value increments by 1 and is now `2`.
            (_When we program this, the array wont be mutated, we will instead
            calculate it using the modulus operator (`%`). `(1 + 0) % 3 = 1`,
            `(1 + 1) % 3 = 2`, and `(1 + 2) % 3 = 0`_)
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            This allows us to animate our leds. We can take it a step further by
            nesting it another loop that would fade into the next "frame". Check
            out the before and after adding this effect in the video below. The
            effect without the fade goes outward, while the one with the fade
            goes inward. Notice how the inward effect looks drastically
            smoother:

            If we follow this approach, we can create awesome looking visuals in
            minutes and have it automatically animate for us with very low
            memory usage. In fact, with 4 effects I was able to get my binary
            size for variables down to 1.1kb! This was drastically lower than
            just having 1 or 2 effects at 1.4kb.

          <Title>Creating The Visuals</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            For this guide, we will create a simple design that has a horizontal
            line that goes from the top of the mask to the bottom. First step is
            to create the 1d array that's formatted in the shape of our mask
            (place this in the `loop` method):
          </Paragraph>

            `uint_least8_t`: This sets out integers to be 8 bits, which is
            drastically smaller than a normal `int`. Since we aren't using large
            integers for this array, 8 bits is suffice.

          <Paragraph>
            `0,..1,...2,...6`: The 1d array is in the shape of our mask, with
            the first row being 26. Each row share a value that increments by 1
            for every row. This means that the first row would be color `0` in
            the first "frame", and the last row would be color `6`. The next
            frame would shift it so that the first row would be `1`, and the
            last one would be `0`.

            Let's also define our pattern colors and call it `lineColors`:

          <Paragraph>
            These values don't mean much as we don't have colors defined, but
            this does tell us a horizontal line of 2 pixels wide will go from
            the bottom to the top of the mask (We want to reverse this in the
            future).

          <Paragraph>
            We can now work on the pattern method, focused only on showing the
            LEDs in the 0th iteration, without worrying about animations or
            fading.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The FastLED library makes it very easy to set the color for an LED.
            If we want to set the first LED to red, we can do so via `leds[0] =
            CRGB(100, 0, 0)`. However, it won't show until we call
            `FastLED.show()`. So lets loop through the pattern array and map the
            LEDs to the appropriate color:
          </Paragraph>
          <CodeBlock language="cpp">
            {`void pattern(uint_least8_t pattern[NUM_LEDS], uint_least8_t patternColors[], bool reverse, float speed, uint_least8_t max) {

    {5, 160, 60},
    {0, 30, 170},
  };
  for (uint_least8_t i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++) {
    uint_least8_t color = pattern[i];
    leds[i] = CRGB(
      colors[patternColors[color]][0],
      colors[patternColors[color]][1],
      colors[patternColors[color]][2]

          <Paragraph>
            `uint_least8_t color = pattern[i];`: This gets us the pattern color
            index from `pattern`

          <Paragraph>

          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `colors[patternColors[color]][0]`: This grabs the color from the
            `colors` array using the `color` variable and grabs the 0th index to
            represent the `R` in `RGB`. It does the same for `G` and `B`.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `FastLED.show();`: Displays the LEDs after all of the LEDs are set,
            so that they show all at once rather than one at a time.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `FastLED.delay(100);`: Delays each render by 100ms, this can be
            adjusted to cause a larger delay. This helps keep our animations at
            a consistent speed.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>This will result in the mask looking like this:</Paragraph>
          <LazyLoadImage alt="Image of the led mask at the static state. There is a few row of leds that are pink and some that are blue." className="full-width-img" src={MaskStatic} />
          <Title>Animating The Design</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            To animate the design, we would need to wrap our method in a for
            loop and change the `color` value by 1 on every increment. We will
            use the modulus operator (`%`) to loop any value above `max` back to
            zero.
          </Paragraph>
          <CodeBlock language="cpp">
            {`void pattern(uint_least8_t pattern[NUM_LEDS], uint_least8_t patternColors[], bool reverse, float speed, uint_least8_t max) {

          <Paragraph>
            `(pattern[i] + x) % max;`: Each iteration will increment the
            original pattern value by `1`. If it overflows past `max`, it will
            loop back to `0` because of the modulus operator. Remember that max
            can be anything, as long as there are enough colors.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Be sure that `FastLED.show()` is within the for loop or it wont
            render each iteration! That is all it takes to animate it. Now we
            will need to fade to the next iteration to keep it clean and we are
            done!
          </Paragraph>
          <Title>Fading Iterations</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            Lets take a look at a helper method called `getColorFade` that I
            created for this project:
          </Paragraph>
          <CodeBlock language="cpp">
            {`float getColorFade(uint_least8_t a, uint_least8_t b, uint_least8_t index, uint_least8_t range) {
  if (a == b)
  {
    return a;
  }
  float dif = abs(a - b);
  float change = (float)dif / range;
  change *= (index + 1);
  if (a > b)
  {
    return a - change;
  }
  return a + change;
}`}
          </CodeBlock>
          <Paragraph>
            `float getColorFade`: This method returns a `float` that is supposed
            to represent a color. We use `float` so that it won't round whole
            numbers, to keep the fades clean.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `uint_least8_t a`: This is color `a`, this would be the source color
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `uint_least8_t b`: This is color `b`, this would be the destination
            color
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `uint_least8_t index`: This is the current stage the fade is on. So
            if it is 2 loops in, this would equal to `2` on the 3rd loop (starts
            at 0). This is explained in the next parameter.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `uint_least8_t range`: This is the amount of steps we want the fade
            to occur. So if we want it to fade over 4 iterations, after 1
            iteration it would be 25% of the way from color a to color b. So
            lets say that we want it to fade over 10 iterations. `index` will be
            equal to `0`, going all the way until `9`. When index is `5`, that
            means it is half way towards color `b`.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `if (a == b)`: If the colors are the same, return the color.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `float dif = abs(a - b);`: Get the difference of the two colors.
            `abs` is used so that we don't have any negative values. We just
            want to know the "distance" between the two.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `float change = dif / range`: This is amount we need to add/subtract
            to `a`. Lets pretend `a = 150`, and `b = 50`. The difference between
            the two is `100`. We want to fade to the next color over 5
            increments. So in this case the change would be `20` (100 / 5) a.k.a
            `dif / range`.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `change *= (index + 1);`: The change is then multipled by the
            current index otherwise it won't actually fade. (first loop adds
            `20`, second loop adds `40`, etc.)
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `if (a > b)`: This decides whether we need to add `change` to `a` or
            subtract it. (ex. `a` is `100`, `b` is `50`, so we subtract from `a`
            to get closer to `b`'s value)
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Now for the final loop! Update your `pattern` method:
          </Paragraph>

From my tests, `4` is enough steps to fade to the next color, so I use `z < (4 * speed)` in the for loop. The `speed` parameter exists for us to adjust the speed of the fades. Right now our `pattern` call in `loop()` uses a speed of `1.5` so that means this would fade over 6 iterations. The `z` variable is our `index` for our fade method.'
            }
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `uint_least8_t colorA;`: We create the `colorA` and `colorB`
            variable here so that we can instantiate them depending on if we
            want the effects reversed or not.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `if (reverse)`: The code nested within this if statment is the exact
            same as the `else` statement, just that the variable names are
            reversed. This results in the animations to go in the reverse
            direction.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `colorA = (pattern[i] + x) % max;`: This is the `color` variable we
            had before.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `colorB = (colorA + 1) % max`: This gets the next color before the
            `x` for loop increments to it. So if colorA is `0`, this will return
            `1`.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `getColorFade(...)`: We call our new fade method and pass in all of
            the appropriate parameters. This has to be done for each color.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `patternColors[colorA]][0]`: This gets the value of `colorA` so that
            our fade method can calculate how much to increment and return. The
            same applies to `colors[patternColors[colorB]][0]`.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `(4 * speed)`: We need to multiply our default `4` by speed since we
            can't have the fade for loop fade `6` times and the color fade
            method expecting `4`.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            `FastLED.delay(50);`: The fade method will slow down the animation
            since this delay will be called more times before shifting to the
            next color. I usually like keeping this delay low, but that results
            in more calls to the mask.

            You can now create some designs by creating more pattern arrays and
            pattern colors. In my experience, each design only takes 1-5
            minutes. As long as you remember where the center index is, you can
            make a symmetrical design fairly fast. _Note: Using the multicursor
            feature in your editor helps a TON_
