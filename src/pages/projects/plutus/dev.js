            When I was attending Granite Bay High School, I was in a class
            called GBiT. It was a class for students interested in tech to grow
            their knowledge in it. There were multiple groups in that class, one
            of which was the CS group that I was a part of.

            I knew I wanted to do something in computer science, I just didn't
            know what I exactly wanted to do in that field. I tried making
            videogames in Lua, C++, and in Java but it wasn't something I
            excelled at or wanted to do in the future.

            Eventually, I got into web development and enjoyed it. I wasn't good
            at it, but I was learning. Soon I wanted to try iOS and Android
            development. Unfortunately that was a big task to accomplish at the
            time, so I stuck with designing a prototype mobile app in HTML, CSS,
            and Javascript.

            This was one of the first projects I made while learning html and
            css, so I had difficulty learning how to implement ui frameworks and
            javascript libraries.

            This project was a key stepping stone for me to pursue web
            development and eventually mobile app development. Looking back at
            this project from 5 years ago to today in 2020, I realized how far I
            have come and how important it is to pay attention to detail. Being
            able to feel confident in web development is what pushed me to keep
            learning.
